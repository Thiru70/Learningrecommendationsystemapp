    - Recommendations (All resources with filters)
    - Learning Path (Personalized sequence)
    - Bookmarks (Saved resources)
    - Profile (User stats and history)
  - Notification center in top bar
  - Mobile-responsive with collapsible sidebar
- **Dark Mode**: 
  - Toggle in sidebar
  - Persisted to localStorage
  - Smooth transitions
